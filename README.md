# Automated Sleep Apnea Prediction using CNN+BiLSTM and ResNet1D

This project presents a deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying **sleep apnea** using **ECG signals** from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG dataset. We compare the performance of a **CNN+BiLSTM hybrid model** with a **ResNet1D architecture**, aiming to enable early and accurate diagnosis of sleep apnea using a single-lead ECG signal.

## üìå Objectives

- Detect and classify **obstructive**, **central**, and **mixed sleep apnea** events.
- Use **single-lead ECG signals** for analysis.
- Build two deep learning models:
  - CNN+BiLSTM
  - ResNet1D
- Compare their performance based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score.
